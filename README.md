# AirBnb-NYC-Analysis

### Project Overview  
---
Airbnb is considered one of the biggest hotel chains in the world. And it does not own a single hotel room!

The company became successful by connecting travelers who need a place to stay with the so-called hosts, people who are willing to rent their places. In the Airbnb platform, it is possible to book everything from a shared room in a house with other people to an entire apartment or hotel room.

Founded in 2008, Airbnb has already hosted over 300 million guests and aims to reach 1 billion by the time it turns 20, in 2028.  
The company also makes a lot of its data available for free. Through the Inside Airbnb website, anyone can have access to a great amount of information about Airbnb operation in the most important cities in the world.

In this project, we will work with a dataset of New York City-NYC properties advertised on the platform. This dataset contains information about the prices, locations, reviews, room types, hosts, and more for over 50,000 rooms.

Our main goal is to take some insights from the data, such as the most common room types, locations, and how the prices vary depending on the room type and the location of the property.
